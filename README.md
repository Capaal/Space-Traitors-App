### What is this repository for? ###

* Welcome to a Space Traitor assistant app, designed to accompany the boardgame "Space Traitors" (yet to be released).
	It is primarily an alternative way to manage game state variables and help assist in managing rules and game actions.

### How do I get set up? ###

* To experience the game: Reach out to Jason (see contacts below) as the app works alongside the boardgame.
* The repository contains an up-to-date APK (Under app/Release). Feel free to play around.
* If you just want a copy see below. If you want to contribute contact Jason for write access.

* Set Up: For Mercurial repository work I really like TortoiseHG @ https://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/
* For cloning Mercurial repositories: https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/clone-a-repository-223217891.html
* Android Studio is IDE used.

### Getting Started on the Code ###
* Primary working files:
	ShipActivityFragment
	ShipStatFragment
* Both of the above live within the Page Viewer activity and adapters but are where a majority of the app's interesting features are hosted.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* This is a fairly personal project and is not generally open to contribution. However, that does not mean
	we will ignore you if you reach out to us with interest in the project.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Jason Reed AKA Capaal: Lead Admin reachable @ jasreed.t@gmail.com
